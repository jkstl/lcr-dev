# CLAUDE.md — Local Cognitive RAG (LCR) System
## Authoritative Architectural Blueprint v1.0

> **Purpose**: This document defines the complete technical specification for a local, privacy-first conversational AI assistant with persistent episodic memory. Any coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) should be able to implement this system from this specification alone.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (As of 2026-01-16)

### ✅ Phase 1: MVP Complete
- Vector memory with LanceDB
- Ollama integration (Qwen3:14b + nomic-embed-text)
- Basic CLI with Rich interface
- Conversation persistence

### ✅ Phase 2: Observer System Complete
- Async utility grading (DISCARD/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Entity/relationship extraction
- Summary generation
- Retrieval query pre-generation
- **Fire-and-forget processing** (30-60s delay before memories persist)

### ✅ Phase 3: Graph Database Complete
- FalkorDB integration via Docker
- Person & Entity nodes in graph
- Relationship tracking (WORKS_AT, KNOWS, OWNS, PLANS_TO, CURRENTLY_USING_AS, etc.)
- **Contradiction detection & supersession** (marks old facts as `still_valid: false`)
- Graph-enhanced context assembly
- **Temporal intent/state relationships** (v0.3.1) - Observer extracts temporal changes

### ✅ Phase 4: Cross-Encoder Reranking Complete (v0.4.0)
- BGE-Reranker-v2-m3 integration
- Two-stage retrieval: vector search (top-15) → rerank → select (top-5)
- Improved memory relevance scoring vs vector-only
- GPU/CPU device auto-detection with graceful fallback
- Configurable via settings (can disable with `use_reranker: false`)

### ⏸️ Deferred Features
- Voice interface (Whisper STT + Piper TTS)
- LangGraph orchestration
- Redis task queue

### 🐛 Known Issues
1. **~~Observer Processing Delay~~**: ✅ **Improved** - Observer now uses smaller `qwen3:4b` model (configurable via `observer_model` setting) instead of main 14B model, significantly reducing processing time.
2. **Docker Setup**: FalkorDB requires Docker Compose V2 (`/usr/local/bin/docker-compose` on Ubuntu 24.04 due to distutils compatibility)
3. **Model**: Main LLM uses `qwen3:14b`, Observer uses `qwen3:4b`
4. **~~Entity Extraction Limitations~~**: ✅ **FIXED** (v0.3.1) - Observer now extracts temporal intent/state relationships (PLANS_TO, CURRENTLY_USING_AS, IN_STATE, etc.) in addition to ownership. Contradiction detection now works for intent changes like "planning to sell" → "using as home server". Enhanced extraction prompt includes temporal relationship types and metadata guidance.
5. **Graph Contradiction Detection**: Requires FalkorDB to be running via Docker. Without it, Observer still extracts entities/relationships but cannot detect contradictions or persist to graph store.

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 What This System Does
A voice-enabled conversational AI that:
- Remembers everything the user tells it across sessions (work schedules, relationships, owned technology, preferences)
- Retrieves relevant memories automatically when answering questions
- Learns the user's personality, communication style, and life context over time
- Runs 100% locally with zero external API calls

### 1.2 Example Interactions After Training
```
User: "What time do I need to be at work tomorrow?"
System: [Retrieves: User works at Acme Corp, shift starts 9am, 30min commute]
Response: "You need to leave by 8:30. Your shift at Acme starts at 9, and with your usual commute from Cedar Park, that gives you a small buffer."

User: "Should I text Sarah back?"
System: [Retrieves: Recent tension with Sarah, user expressed feeling overwhelmed, Sarah's communication pattern]
Response: "Based on what you've shared, you were feeling pretty drained after your last exchange. If you're not ready, it's okay to wait until tomorrow. What's making you hesitate?"
```

### 1.3 Hardware Constraints
| Resource | Limit | Allocation Strategy |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| VRAM | 16GB | Main LLM ~10GB, Reranker ~0.5GB, Buffer ~5.5GB |
| System RAM | 32GB | Vector DB, Graph DB, Application |
| Storage | SSD Required | LanceDB disk-persistence, conversation logs |
| Network | None | 100% air-gapped capable |
